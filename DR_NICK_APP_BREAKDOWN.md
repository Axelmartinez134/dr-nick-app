## **🚀 How It Gets From Your Computer To The Internet**

### **The Deployment Process:**
1. **You write code** in Cursor
2. **Push to GitHub** → Your code gets backed up
3. **Vercel watches GitHub** → Automatically sees new changes
4. **Vercel builds the app** → Turns code into a website
5. **Vercel publishes it** → Makes it available worldwide
6. **People visit your URL** → See the live app

### **What Happens Every Time You Make Changes:**
