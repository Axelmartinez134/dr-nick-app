# The Fittest You Health Tracker

Dr. Nick's patient health tracking application built with Next.js, Supabase, and TypeScript.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Mode for Testing

**No complicated files needed!** Simply use the **Developer Mode button** in the patient form:

### ‚úÖ Simple Testing Steps:
1. Log in as any patient
2. Go to "Weekly Check-in" tab
3. Click the **"Dev Mode OFF"** button to turn it **ON** (yellow)
4. Select any week (1-20) from the dropdown
5. Submit forms for any week to test charts and data
6. Click **"Dev Mode ON"** to turn it **OFF** for normal operation

### üéØ What Developer Mode Does:
- **ON**: Manual week selection - test any week
- **OFF**: Smart week calculation based on submission history

### üìÖ Smart Week Calculation Logic:
- **First submission**: Week 1
- **Within 3 days of last submission**: Can resubmit to same week
- **4-10 days since last submission**: Moves to next week  
- **More than 10 days**: Calculates weeks passed automatically
- **Grace period**: Patients get 3 days to submit after their expected week

## üß† Smart Algorithm

The system calculates the current week by analyzing:
1. **Previous submissions** - Finds highest week number and most recent date
2. **Time gaps** - Calculates days since last submission
3. **Grace periods** - Allows 3-day window for late submissions
4. **Week progression** - Automatically advances based on time passed
5. **Error handling** - Defaults to Week 1 for new users or errors

**No database changes required** - Pure conditional logic using existing data!
