const MESSAGE_TEMPLATE = `Good evening, {{patient_first_name}}.

I hope your week went well!

[We currently have you biased towards higher fat/lower carb which we will continue to maintain until I notice two concurrent weeks of you waking up in fat burn ('1' or a '2') every single morning. As that is achieved (which means your body has made exceptional progress is achieving competency in at least one end of the metabolic flexibility spectrum - oxidizing fat) throughout my constantly adapting plan for you, I will shift you slowly towards more and more carbs and less and less fat, trending upwards throughout your plan until you are very efficient at burning whatever you eat, fat or carbs, when within the context of negative energy balance. As this happens, every metabolic health parameter we have stored from your lab results you shared with me will improve.]

As it relates to your macronutrient targets (energy intake), I continue to input them in for the coming day the night prior and will also continue to adjust them downwards as you lose weight (because if I do not adjust them downwards throughout your plan, your weight loss will eventually stall and plateau) but before I do that, I *always* look for very specific checkpoints to occur: no hunger reported from you for a few weeks, you consistently hitting the macronutrient goals, consistent sleep cycle times (I don't care so much about recovery scores as that is not within your direct controlâ€¦but your sleep times are within your direct control), and a consistent low intensity exercise regimen.

Looking at your updated and current "plateau prevention" data, you are currently at a {{plateau_prevention_rate}}% rate of loss over time {{plateau_prevention_status}} and you are {{trend_direction}} relative to last week, meaning that your rate of progress (for weight loss, but we can change this graph to waist circumference loss if you would like) is {{trend_description}} when considering the {{current_week_number}} week average of your weekly progress. Most currently, your {{week_count}} week average rate of loss is {{week_average_loss_rate}}% loss of your body weight per week. The four pillars of metabolic health all influence this number: nutrition, exercise, recovery, and stress management.

This changes weekly, please read thoroughly and respond to any questions I ask you within this:
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

You are currently losing weight *OVERALL* (since we started) at a rate of {{overall_loss_rate_percent}}% (your goal that you and I set together when you started was {{goal_loss_rate_percent}}% per week) of your total weight per week and are {{total_waist_loss_inches}} inches total on your waist. The "ðŸ“Š Weight Loss Trend vs. Projections" columns of your dashboard will show you your estimated weight for whatever week in the future you'd like to know, given the current overall rate of weight loss I've shared with you.

Each and every one of us can only prioritize certain things in our lives so much compared to other more pressing demands and I never want to push you towards improvement of your metabolic health at a rate faster than you are comfortable with or, more importantly, feel that you cannot sustain long term so if you are happy with your current rate of progress then we do not need to change anything. If you would like to improve and accelerate your current rate of progress, I have a few recommendations for you.

The highest priority of all recommendations is continue to be compliant with your daily protein goal of {{protein_goal_grams}} grams (+/- 3 grams). Any daily protein intake of you outside of this range ({{protein_goal_lower_bound}} grams to {{protein_goal_upper_bound}} grams) is considered a failure of achieving the daily protein goal and, with it, the nutrition goal for the day (even if you have managed to stay within your net carb and fat allotments). I cannot overstate how important achieving this range of protein daily is. Otherwise, considering your daily net carb and fat goals, it is most ideal to stay under their daily recommendations but if satiety isn't present on any given day with lower than recommended carbs/fats and you are feeling particularly hungry, I would recommend you eat all the carbs/fats recommended (up to 3 grams above) as long as you have made sure that you will also eat all grams of your recommended daily protein goal (above) on that same day. Eating under your daily protein goal will leave you feeling hungry and MUCH more likely to overeat on fat and carbs. Considering these protein/carb/fat recommendations, your weekly macronutrient compliance this week was {{weekly_compliance_percent}}%. Improving, and then maintaining, weekly macronutrient compliance given the contribution that it plays in your overall compliance (% average days goal met on your Interface) would absolutely help accelerate your rate of progress.`
